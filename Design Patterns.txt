What is Pattern?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. 
They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.


	1. Creational Design Patterns
	2. Structural Design Patterns
	3. Behavioral Design Patterns
	

Creational Design Patterns Types:

	1. Factory Method.
		- Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
		- When to use this pattern:
			a) Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
			b) Use the Factory Method when you want to extend its internal components without breaking the initial client implementation.
			c) Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.
